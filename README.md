# Hi 👋, I'm [Your Name]

### A passionate developer from Colombia

</div>

## 🚀 About Me

I focus on software development with a backend-oriented approach. I mainly work with Java and Spring Boot, building APIs, managing databases, and organizing code with a clean and scalable architecture mindset. I also use FastAPI with Python to develop lightweight and efficient services.

I have experience in frontend development using Angular, as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allows me to build modern, functional, and well-structured user interfaces.
I'm interested in understanding how systems work internally, writing clear code, and following good practices. I aim to continue growing as a developer through real-world projects, continuous learning, and challenges that help me advance both technically and professionally.

| CoderBoost | CoderBoost es una plataforma diseñada para impulsar el crecimiento de desarrolladores, combinando formación práctica, proyectos reales y enfoque profesional para acelerar su camino en el mundo tech. | [Live](https://cb-front.vercel.app/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/SebitasDown/cb-front?tab=readme-ov-file) |
| MicroServiceIA-BarberDev | Independent microservice designed to process and analyze images using artificial intelligence within a barber shop application. It exposes a REST API that allows image uploads, cloud storage, and communication with an AI provider for processing.

The service is built with Spring Boot and follows a decoupled architecture, making it easy to integrate with other systems. It uses Cloudinary for image management and storage and connects to AI providers such as OpenAI or Gemini, depending on the configuration, enabling flexibility and scalability.

The project focuses on proper separation of responsibilities, integration with external services, and the design of a production-ready microservice within a distributed environment. | [Live](https://barberdev-microservice.onrender.com/) / [GitHub](https://github.com/BarberIA-Dev/BarberDev-Microservice) |
| LogiFlow | Frontend application designed to provide an intuitive and responsive interface for managing processes and workflows within a microservices-based system. It focuses on delivering a clear user experience while interacting with multiple backend services through secure APIs.

The frontend is built using Angular, consuming REST APIs secured with OAuth 2.0 and JWT. It handles authentication flows, role-based access, and dynamic views based on user permissions, ensuring a scalable and maintainable user interface.

The project emphasizes modular component design, state management, and clean separation of concerns, making the frontend suitable for real-world, production-ready applications. | [GitHub](https://github.com/xXCpFireXx/LogiFlow-Frontend) |
